This migration note helps you to move from |NCS| v3.1.x `Serial LTE modem (SLM) <Serial LTE modem_>`_ to the |addon|.

There are several breaking changes between |addon| and |NCS| SLM, such as renaming, file movement, AT command changes, overlay file changes, and so on.
The following sections cover all the changes that must be taken into account.

Background
**********

The base of the |addon| repository is a copy of |NCS| SLM and related components from the |NCS| commit ``437f372b37849fe215243f8de48847d578976c13``.
Most of the |SM| application APIs remain the same as in the |NCS| SLM, but with significant breaking changes from the host implementation's perspective in the future versions of the |addon|.

The following |NCS| files were copied into this repository:

* :file:`applications/serial_lte_modem` to :file:`app`
* :file:`lib/modem_slm` to :file:`lib/sm_host`
* :file:`samples/cellular/slm_shell` to :file:`samples/sm_host_shell`
* :file:`include/modem/modm_slm.h` to :file:`include/sm_host.h`
* :file:`doc/nrf/libraries/modem/modem_slm.rst` to :file:`doc/lib/sm_host.rst`

Required changes
****************

The following changes are mandatory to make your application work in the same way as in previous releases.

   This section gives instructions on how to migrate from the NCS v3.1.x Serial LTE Modem to the |SM| Add-On:

   * Rename the use of the following Kconfig options:

     * Rename ``CONFIG_SLM_*`` to ``CONFIG_SM_*``
     * Rename ``CONFIG_MODEM_SLM_*`` to ``CONFIG_SM_HOST_*``

   * Code patches:

     * Renamed the file name from ``slm_`` to ``sm_`` and ``modem_slm`` to ``sm_host``.
     * Functions and other symbols in the code have been renamed accordingly making automatic patching to likely fail.

   * Default AT command terminator changed from ``\r\n`` (``CONFIG_SM_CR_LF_TERMINATION`` and ``CONFIG_SM_HOST_CR_LF_TERMINATION``) to ``\r`` (``CONFIG_SM_CR_TERMINATION`` and ``CONFIG_SM_HOST_CR_TERMINATION``).

   * Rename the following AT commands:

     * ``AT#GPS`` to ``AT#GNSS``
     * ``AT#XGPSDEL`` command has been renamed to ``AT#XGNSSDEL``

   * Removed the ``AT#XPOLL`` command.
     Use ``AT#XAPOLL`` instead.

DTR and RI GPIOs replace Power and Indicate pins
------------------------------------------------

The |SM| application uses DTR (Data Terminal Ready) and RI (Ring Indicator) pins to manage the UART power state instead of Power and Indicate pins used in the |NCS| SLM.

* Removed:

  * The Power pin, which was active low input, expected a short pulse and was configured with ``CONFIG_SLM_POWER_PIN``.
  * The Indicate pin, which was active low output, sent a pulse configured with ``CONFIG_SLM_INDICATE_TIME`` and was configured with ``CONFIG_SLM_INDICATE_PIN``.

* Added:

  * DTR pin, which is a level based input, that is configured in the devicetree with the ``dtr-gpios`` property.
  * RI pin, which is a pulse based output, that is configured in the devicetree with the ``ri-gpios`` property.

See :ref:`sm_dtr_ri` for more information on how DTR and RI pins work in the |SM| application.
See :ref:`sm_as_zephyr_modem` for information on how to configure DTR and RI pins when using the |SM| application as a Zephyr modem.

Socket AT commands updated to handle-based API
----------------------------------------------

The socket AT commands have been updated to use a handle-based approach instead of socket selection.
This provides more flexibility and clearer socket management by directly referencing socket handles in all operations.

   * **Removed commands:**

     * ``AT#XSOCKETSELECT`` - Socket selection is no longer needed. Each command now directly specifies the socket handle.

   * **Updated socket creation:**

     * ``AT#XSOCKET`` - No longer supports closing sockets (``op=0`` removed). Only creates sockets and returns a handle.
     * ``AT#XSSOCKET`` - No longer supports closing sockets (``op=0`` removed). Only creates secure sockets and returns a handle.

   * **New socket closing:**

     * ``AT#XCLOSE`` - New command to close individual sockets or all sockets at once.
     * Syntax: ``AT#XCLOSE[=<handle>]`` (handle is optional - omit to close all sockets)

   * **All socket operations now require handle parameter:**

     * ``AT#XSOCKETOPT=<handle>,<op>,<name>[,<value>]`` (handle parameter added)
     * ``AT#XSSOCKETOPT=<handle>,<op>,<name>[,<value>]`` (handle parameter added)
     * ``AT#XBIND=<handle>,<port>`` (handle parameter added)
     * ``AT#XCONNECT=<handle>,<url>,<port>`` (handle parameter added)
     * ``AT#XLISTEN=<handle>`` (handle parameter added)
     * ``AT#XACCEPT=<handle>,<timeout>`` (handle parameter added)
     * ``AT#XSEND=<handle>[,<data>][,<flags>]`` (handle parameter added)
     * ``AT#XRECV=<handle>,<timeout>[,<flags>]`` (handle parameter added)
     * ``AT#XSENDTO=<handle>,<url>,<port>[,<data>][,<flags>]`` (handle parameter added)
     * ``AT#XRECVFROM=<handle>,<timeout>[,<flags>]`` (handle parameter added)

   * **Response format changes:**

     * ``AT#XSOCKETOPT`` - Response to get options now includes socket handle: ``#XSOCKETOPT: <handle>,<value>`` (previously just ``#XSOCKETOPT: <value>``)
     * ``AT#XSSOCKETOPT`` - Response to get options now includes socket handle: ``#XSSOCKETOPT: <handle>,<value>`` (previously just ``#XSSOCKETOPT: <value>``)
     * ``AT#XCONNECT`` - Response now includes socket handle: ``#XCONNECT: <handle>,<status>`` (previously just ``#XCONNECT: <status>``)
     * ``AT#XSEND`` - Response now includes socket handle: ``#XSEND: <handle>,<size>`` (previously just ``#XSEND: <size>``)
     * ``AT#XRECV`` - Response now includes socket handle: ``#XRECV: <handle>,<size>`` (previously just ``#XRECV: <size>``)
     * ``AT#XSENDTO`` - Response now includes socket handle: ``#XSENDTO: <handle>,<size>`` (previously just ``#XSENDTO: <size>``)
     * ``AT#XRECVFROM`` - Response now includes socket handle: ``#XRECVFROM: <handle>,<size>,"<ip_addr>",<port>`` (previously just ``#XRECVFROM: <size>,"<ip_addr>",<port>``)

   * **Migration example:**

     **Old approach (NCS SLM):**

     .. code-block::

        AT#XSOCKET=1,1,0          // Open socket, returns handle 1
        AT#XCONNECT="server",80   // Connect socket handle 1
        AT#XSEND="data"           // Send on socket handle 1
        AT#XSOCKET=1,1,0          // Open socket, returns handle 2
        AT#XCONNECT="server",80   // Connect socket handle 2
        AT#XSOCKETSELECT=1        // Select socket handle 1
        AT#XSOCKET=0              // Close selected socket handle 1

     **New approach (Serial Modem add-on):**

     .. code-block::

        AT#XSOCKET=1,1,0          // Open socket, returns handle 1
        AT#XCONNECT=1,"server",80 // Connect socket handle 1
        AT#XSEND=1,"data"         // Send on socket handle 1
        AT#XSOCKET=1,1,0          // Open socket, returns handle 2
        AT#XCONNECT=2,"server",80 // Connect socket handle 2
        AT#XCLOSE=1               // Close socket handle 1

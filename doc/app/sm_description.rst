The |SM| (SM) application demonstrates how to use an nRF91 Series device as a stand-alone modem that can be controlled by AT commands.

Overview
********

The nRF91 Series SiP integrates both a full LTE modem and an application MCU, enabling you to run your application directly on the device.

However, if you want to run your application on a different chip and use the nRF91 Series device only as a modem, the |SM| application provides you with an interface for controlling the modem through AT commands.

The application accepts both the modem specific AT commands and proprietary AT commands.
The AT commands are documented in the following guides:

* Modem specific AT commands - `nRF91x1 AT Commands Reference Guide`_  and `nRF9160 AT Commands Reference Guide`_
* Proprietary AT commands - :ref:`SM_AT_commands`

Requirements
************

The application supports the following development kits:

     - PCA10165
     - `nrf9131ek`_
     - ``nrf9131ek/nrf9131/ns``

For more security, it is recommended to use the ``*/ns`` `variant <app_boards_names_>`_ of the board target.
When built for this variant, the sample is configured to compile and run as a non-secure application using `security by separation <ug_tfm_security_by_separation_>`_.
Therefore, it automatically includes `Trusted Firmware-M <ug_tfm_>`_ that prepares the required peripherals and secure services to be available for the application.

CONFIG_SM_PGPS_INJECT_FIX_DATA - Injects the data obtained when acquiring a fix.
   This option, if enabled, when a fix is acquired the current location and time will be passed to the P-GPS subsystem.
   It allows you to speed up the time it takes to acquire the next fix when A-GNSS is disabled or unavailable.
   This can be detrimental to short TTFF if the device is expected to move distances longer than a few dozen kilometers between fix attempts.
   In that case, this option should be disabled.
   The default value is ``y``.


.. _sm_additional_config:

Additional configuration
========================

To save power, both the console and the output logs over ``UART_0`` are disabled in this application.
This information is logged using RTT instead.
See `Testing and optimization`_ for instructions on how to view this information.

To switch to UART output, change the following options in the :file:`prj.conf` file::

   # Segger RTT
   CONFIG_USE_SEGGER_RTT=n
   CONFIG_RTT_CONSOLE=n
   CONFIG_UART_CONSOLE=y
   CONFIG_LOG_BACKEND_RTT=n
   CONFIG_LOG_BACKEND_UART=y

.. _sm_config_files:

Configuration files
===================

You can find the configuration files in the :file:`app` directory.

In general, they have an ``overlay-`` prefix, and a :file:`.conf` or :file:`.overlay` extension for Kconfig or devicetree overlays, respectively.
Board-specific configuration files are named :file:`<BOARD>` with a :file:`.conf` or :file:`.overlay` extension and are located in the :file:`boards` directory.
When the name of the board-specific configuration file matches the board target, the overlay is automatically included by the build system.

See `Build and configuration system`_ for more information on the |NCS| configuration system.

.. important::

  When adding Kconfig fragments and devicetree overlays, make sure to use the :makevar:`EXTRA_CONF_FILE` and :makevar:`EXTRA_DTC_OVERLAY_FILE` `CMake options <cmake_options_>`_, respectively.
  Otherwise, if :makevar:`CONF_FILE` or :makevar:`DTC_OVERLAY_FILE` is used, all the configuration files that normally get picked up automatically will have to be included explicitly.

The following configuration files are provided:

* :file:`prj.conf` - This configuration file contains the standard configuration for the |SM| application and is included by default by the build system.

* :file:`overlay-external-mcu.overlay` - This configures the |SM| application to communicate with external MCU over ``uart2``, using specific pins for UART, DTR, and RI.
  The overlay is pin compatible with nRF9160DK, nRF9151DK, and nRF9161DK.
  For other setups, you can customize the overlay to fit your configuration.

* :file:`overlay-native_tls.conf` - This configuration file contains additional configuration options that are required to use :ref:`sm_native_tls`.
  Not supported with the ``thingy91/nrf9160/ns`` board target due to flash memory constraints.
  If you need to use native TLS with Thingy:91, you must disable features to free up flash memory.

* :file:`overlay-carrier.conf` - Configuration file that adds |NCS| `LwM2M carrier`_ support.
  See :ref:`sm_carrier_library_support` for more information on how to connect to an operator's device management platform.
  With the ``thingy91/nrf9160/ns`` board target, you must additionally pass the sysbuild option ``-DSB_CONFIG_THINGY91_STATIC_PARTITIONS_LWM2M_CARRIER=y`` to fit the application in the flash memory.
  This means that you will need an external debug probe to program the application.
  See the `Updating the Thingy:91 firmware using nRF Connect for Desktop apps <Thingy91_firmware_desktop_app_>`_ for more information.

* :file:`overlay-carrier-softbank.conf` and :file:`sysbuild-softbank.conf` - Configuration files that add SoftBank configurations needed by the carrier library.
  Used in conjunction with :file:`overlay-carrier.conf`.
  For more information, see the `Carrier-specific dependencies`_ section of the `LwM2M carrier`_ documentation.
* :file:`overlay-carrier-lgu.conf` - This configuration file adds LG U+ configurations needed by the carrier library.
  Used in conjunction with :file:`overlay-carrier.conf`.
  For more information, see the `Carrier-specific dependencies`_ section of the `LwM2M carrier`_ documentation.

* :file:`overlay-full_fota.conf` - Configuration file that adds full modem FOTA support.
  See :ref:`SM_AT_FOTA` for more information on how to use full modem FOTA functionality.

* :file:`overlay-cmux.conf` - Configuration file that adds support for the CMUX protocol.
  See :ref:`SM_AT_CMUX` for more information.

* :file:`overlay-ppp.conf` - Configuration file that adds support for the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP).
  This disables most of the IP-based protocols available through AT commands (such as FTP and MQTT) as it is expected that the controlling chip's own IP stack is used instead.
  See :ref:`CONFIG_SM_PPP <CONFIG_SM_PPP>` and :ref:`SM_AT_PPP` for more information.

* :file:`overlay-ppp-without-cmux.conf` - Configuration file that enables support for the second UART to be used by PPP.
  This configuration file should be included when building |SM| with PPP and without CMUX, in addition to :file:`overlay-ppp.conf` and :file:`overlay-ppp-without-cmux.overlay`.

* :file:`overlay-ppp-without-cmux.overlay` - Devicetree overlay that configures the second UART to be used by PPP.
  This configuration file should be included when building |SM| with PPP and without CMUX, in addition to :file:`overlay-ppp.conf` and :file:`overlay-ppp-without-cmux.conf`.
  It can be customized to fit your configuration, such as UART settings, baud rate, and flow control.
  By default, it sets the baud rate of the PPP UART to 1 000 000.

* :file:`overlay-memfault.conf` - Configuration file that enables `Memfault`_.
  For more information about Memfault features in |NCS|, see the `Memfault library`_ docs.

* :file:`overlay-disable-dtr.overlay` - Devicetree overlay that disables the DTR and RI pins and related functionality.
  This overlay can be used if your setup does not have the need or means for managing the power externally.
  Modify the overlay to fit your configuration.

* :file:`overlay-zephyr-modem.conf`, :file:`overlay-zephyr-modem-external-mcu.overlay`, :file:`overlay-zephyr-modem-nrf9160dk-nrf52840.conf`, and :file:`overlay-zephyr-modem-nrf9160dk-nrf52840.overlay` - These configuration files are used when compiling |SM| to turn an nRF91 Series SiP into a Zephyr-compatible standalone modem.
  See :ref:`sm_as_zephyr_modem` for more information.

The board-specific devicetree overlays (:file:`boards/*.overlay`) set up configurations that are specific to each supported development kit.
All of them configure the DTR to be deasserted from a button and RI to blink an LED.

.. _sm_native_tls:

Native TLS
----------

By default, the secure socket (TLS/DTLS) is offloaded to the modem.
If you need customized TLS/DTLS features that are not supported by the modem firmware, you can use native TLS instead.
Native TLS uses the Mbed TLS library in Zephyr to establish secure connectivity.
Currently, the |SM| application can be built to use native TLS for the following services:

* Secure socket
* TLS Proxy client
* TLS Proxy server
* DTLS Proxy client
* DTLS Proxy server
* HTTPS client

With native TLS, the credentials are stored in the Zephyr settings storage with the ``AT#XCMNG`` command.

The configuration options that are required to enable native TLS are defined in the :file:`overlay-native_tls.conf` file.

.. note::

   Native TLS services have the following limitations:

   * TLS session resumption is currently not supported.

Sending traces over UART on an nRF91 Series DK
==============================================

To send modem traces over UART on an nRF91 Series DK, configuration must be added for the UART device in the devicetree and Kconfig.
This is done by adding the `modem trace UART snippet`_ when building and programming.

Use the `Cellular Monitor app`_ for capturing and analyzing modem traces.

TF-M logging must use the same UART as the application. For more details, see `shared TF-M logging`_.

.. _sm_building:

Building and running
********************

The |SM| application can be found under :file:`app` in the |SM| folder structure.

For more security, it is recommended to use the ``*/ns`` `variant <app_boards_names_>`_ of the board target (see the Requirements section above.)
When built for this variant, the sample is configured to compile and run as a non-secure application using `security by separation <ug_tfm_security_by_separation_>`_.
Therefore, it automatically includes `Trusted Firmware-M <ug_tfm_>`_ that prepares the required peripherals and secure services to be available for the application.

To build the sample, follow the instructions in `Building an application`_ for your preferred building environment.
See also `Programming an application`_ for programming steps and `Testing and optimization`_ for general information about testing and debugging in the |NCS|.

.. note::
   |sysbuild_autoenabled_ncs|

.. _sm_connecting_91dk:

Communicating with the modem on an nRF91 Series DK
==================================================

In this scenario, an nRF91 Series DK running the |SM| application serves as the host.
You can use either a PC or an external MCU as a client.

.. _sm_connecting_91dk_pc:

Connecting with a PC
--------------------

To connect to an nRF91 Series DK with a PC:

.. sm_connecting_91dk_pc_instr_start

1. Verify that ``UART_0`` is selected in the application.
   It is defined in the default configuration.

2. Use the `Serial Terminal app`_ to connect to the development kit.
   See `Testing and optimization`_ for instructions.
   You can also use the :guilabel:`Open Serial Terminal` option of the `Cellular Monitor app`_ to open the Serial Terminal app.
   Using the Cellular Monitor app in combination with the Serial Terminal app shows how the modem responds to the different modem commands.
   You can then use this connection to send or receive AT commands over UART, and to see the log output of the development kit.

   Instead of using the Serial Terminal app, you can use PuTTY to establish a terminal connection to the development kit, using the `default serial port connection settings <Testing and optimization_>`_.

   .. note::

      The default AT command terminator is a carriage return (``\r``).
      The Serial Terminal app, PuTTY and many terminal emulators support this format by default.
      However, make sure that the configured AT command terminator corresponds to the line terminator of your terminal.
      See :ref:`sm_config_options` for more details on AT command terminator choices.

.. sm_connecting_91dk_pc_instr_end

.. _sm_connecting_91dk_mcu:

Connecting with an external MCU
-------------------------------

.. note::

   This section does not apply to Thingy:91, Thingy:91 X, or nRF9131 EK.

If you run your user application on an external MCU (for example, an nRF52 Series development kit), you can control the |SM| application on an nRF91 Series device directly from the application.
See the :ref:`sm_shell_sample` for a sample implementation of such an application.

To connect with an external MCU using UART_2, include the :file:`overlay-external-mcu.overlay` devicetree overlay in your build.
This overlay configures the UART_2 pins, DTR pin, and RI pin for the nRF9160 DK, nRF9151 DK, and nRF9161 DK.

If you use a different setup, you can customize the :file:`overlay-external-mcu.overlay` file to match your hardware configuration in (for example) the following ways:

* Change the highlighted UART baud rate or DTR and RI pins::

   &uart2 {
      compatible = "nordic,nrf-uarte";
      current-speed = <**115200**>;
      hw-flow-control;
      status = "okay";

      dtr_uart2: dtr-uart {
         compatible = "nordic,dtr-uart";
         dtr-gpios = <**&gpio0 31** (GPIO_PULL_UP | GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW)>;
         ri-gpios = <**&gpio0 30** GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
         status = "okay";
      };
      pinctrl-0 = <&uart2_default_alt>;
      pinctrl-1 = <&uart2_sleep_alt>;
      pinctrl-names = "default", "sleep";
   };

* Change the highlighted UART pins::

   &pinctrl {
      uart2_default_alt: uart2_default_alt {
         group1 {
            psels = <NRF_PSEL(UART_RX, **0, 11**)>,
                    <NRF_PSEL(UART_CTS, **0, 13**)>;
            bias-pull-up;
         };
         group2 {
            psels = <NRF_PSEL(UART_TX, **0, 10**)>,
                    <NRF_PSEL(UART_RTS, **0, 12**)>;
         };
      };

      uart2_sleep_alt: uart2_sleep_alt {
         group1 {
            psels = <NRF_PSEL(UART_TX, **0, 10**)>,
                    <NRF_PSEL(UART_RX, **0, 11**)>,
                    <NRF_PSEL(UART_RTS, **0, 12**)>,
                    <NRF_PSEL(UART_CTS, **0, 13**)>;
            low-power-enable;
         };
      };
   };

The following table shows how to connect selected development kit to an nRF91 Series development kit to be able to communicate through UART:

           - GPIO GND

Use the following UART devices:

* nRF52 or nRF53 Series DK - UART0
* nRF91 Series DK - UART2

The UART configuration must match on both sides.
By default the |SM| application and :ref:`sm_shell_sample` use the following settings:

* Hardware flow control: enabled
* Baud rate: 115200
* Parity bit: no

.. note::
   The GPIO output level on the nRF91 Series device side must be 3 V.

   * For nRF91x1 DK, you can set the VDD voltage with the `Board Configurator app`_.
   * For nRF9160 DK, you can set the VDD voltage with the **VDD IO** switch (**SW9**).
     See the `VDD supply rail section in the nRF9160 DK User Guide`_ for more information related to nRF9160 DK.

--------------------

The nRF52840 SoC of Thingy:91 is pre-programmed with the `Connectivity bridge`_ application.
To update the Connectivity bridge application, see the `Updating the Thingy:91 firmware using nRF Connect for Desktop apps <Thingy91_firmware_desktop_app_>`_  documentation.
The Connectivity bridge application routes ``UART_0`` to ``USB_CDC0`` on Thingy:91.
By enabling the ``CONFIG_BRIDGE_BLE_ENABLE`` Kconfig option in the Connectivity bridge application, you can also use |SM| over `Nordic UART Service (NUS) <Nordic UART Service_>`_.

To connect to a Thingy:91 with a PC:

.. include:: sm_description.rst
   :start-after: .. sm_connecting_91dk_pc_instr_start
   :end-before: .. sm_connecting_91dk_pc_instr_end

You can also test the i2c sensor on Thingy:91 using :ref:`SM_AT_TWI`.
See :ref:`sm_testing_twi` for more details.

.. _sm_testing_section:

Testing
=======

The following testing instructions focus on testing the application with a PC client.
If you have an nRF52 Series DK running a client application, you can also use this DK for testing the different scenarios.

|test_sample|

1. |connect_kit|
#. `Connect to the kit with the Serial Terminal app <Testing and optimization_>`_.
   You can also use the :guilabel:`Open Serial Terminal` option of the `Cellular Monitor app`_ to open the Serial Terminal app.
   If you want to use a different terminal emulator, see :ref:`sm_connecting_91dk_pc`.
#. Reset the kit.
#. Observe that the development kit sends a ``Ready\r\n`` message on UART.
#. Send AT commands and observe the responses from the development kit.

See :ref:`sm_testing` for typical test cases.

.. note::

   If the initialization of |SM| fails, the application sends an ``INIT ERROR\r\n`` message on UART if it has managed to enable UART.
   See the logs for more information about the error.
   The logs are written to RTT by default.

.. _sm_carrier_library_support:

Using the LwM2M carrier library
===============================

The application supports the |NCS| `LwM2M carrier`_ library that you can use to connect to the operator's device management platform.
See the library's documentation for more information and configuration options.

To enable the LwM2M carrier library, add the parameter ``-DOVERLAY_CONFIG=overlay-carrier.conf`` to your build command.

The CA root certificates that are needed for modem FOTA are not provisioned in the |SM| application.
You can flash the `Cellular: LwM2M carrier`_ sample to write the certificates to modem before flashing the |SM| application, or use the `Cellular: AT Client`_ sample as explained in `preparing the Cellular: LwM2M Client sample for production <lwm2m_client_provisioning_>`_.
It is also possible to modify the |SM| application project itself to include the certificate provisioning, as demonstrated in the `Cellular: LwM2M carrier`_ sample.

.. code-block:: c

   int lwm2m_carrier_event_handler(const lwm2m_carrier_event_t *event)
   {
           switch (event->type) {
           case LWM2M_CARRIER_EVENT_INIT:
                   carrier_cert_provision();
           ...


The certificate provisioning can also be done directly in the |SM| application by using the same AT commands as described for the `Cellular: AT Client`_ sample.

When the `LwM2M carrier`_ library is in use, by default the application will auto-connect to the network on startup.
This behavior can be changed by disabling the :ref:`CONFIG_SM_AUTO_CONNECT <CONFIG_SM_AUTO_CONNECT>` option.

.. ### Versions

.. |NCS| replace:: nRF Connect SDK
.. |addon| replace:: Serial Modem Add-on
.. |SM| replace:: Serial Modem

.. |VSC| replace:: Visual Studio Code
.. |nRFVSC| replace:: nRF Connect for VS Code

.. ### Config shortcuts

.. |config| replace:: See `Configuring and building`_ in the |NCS| documentation for information about how to permanently or temporarily change the configuration.

.. |connect_kit| replace:: Connect the kit to the computer using a USB cable.
   The kit is assigned a serial port.
   Serial ports are referred to as COM ports on Windows, /dev/ttyACM devices on Linux, and /dev/tty devices on macOS.
   To list Nordic Semiconductor devices connected to your computer together with their serial ports, open a terminal and run the ``nrfutil device list`` command.
   Alternatively, check your operating system's device manager or its equivalent.

.. |test_sample| replace:: After programming the sample to your development kit, complete the following steps to test it:

.. ### Other shortcuts

.. |sysbuild_autoenabled_ncs| replace:: When building `repository applications`_ in the `SDK repositories`_, building with sysbuild is `enabled by default <sysbuild_enabled_ncs_>`_.
   If you work with out-of-tree `freestanding applications <create_application_types_freestanding_>`_, you need to manually pass the ``--sysbuild`` parameter to every build command or `configure west to always use it <sysbuild_enabled_ncs_configuring_>`_.

.. |public_ip_address_req| replace:: the nRF91 Series DK must have a public IP address and the radio network must be configured to route incoming IP packets to the nRF91 Series DK.
   These depend on the network and SIM card used.

.. |public_ip_address_check| replace:: To check your current setup, use the ``AT+CGDCONT?`` command to check if the IP address allocated by the network is a reserved IPv4 private address of class A, B, or C (see `Private addresses`_).
   If it is, the device is not reachable from the public network with this IPv4 address and you should try with an IPv6 address instead.
   Generally, IPv6 addresses are more likely to be reachable from the public network.
